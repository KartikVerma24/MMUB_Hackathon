          "  All you need to know before buying this trimmerPros:* Powerful* Sturdy* Sharp and Precise* Ergonomic Shape and Easy to use.* 5 trims in one charge* Usb type charging* Easy to cleanCons:* Charger not provided (only cable is provided)* Charging takes 8 hours.* Only 3 sizes (1mm, 5mm, 7mm)In the process of buying this trimmer, I went through a lot of web surfing. Here is what I found.Brand: No doubt Philips is the best brand for trimmer and shaver as of now.Why Trimmer, and not Shaver or Hybrid of both?This was one of the main doubts. Weather one should go for a trimmer, a shaver or a hybrid of both. Electric shavers does feel pretty smooth and leave less cuts on skin, but don‚Äôt give shaves as close a a razor. If one wants to trim, you‚Äôll anyways need a trimmer. More over, you‚Äôll have to wait for 8 hours of charging to get shaved which can easily be done by a razor too which I think is a big trade off. Hybrid devices can do both shaving and trimming but then they are very expensive with price of almost 4k and above. At this price you can buy both a trimmer and a shaver separately. A philips trimmer price varies from 800 to 2000. Also besides trimming, it can do a job close to shaving. Hence going with a trimmer is a better option.Why BT-1212?This is the lower end model among philips trimmers. The upper end model gave a better battery backup (45min/10hr charge, 60min/10hr charge, 60min/60 min charge) where the price went upto Rs 2000. But we don‚Äôt have to trim on a daily basis and one use won‚Äôt require more than 5-7 min of operation. So 60min of operation is not really a requirement for trimmer. Next talking about blades, I was using a philips trimmer before and it went on working for 5 years. So there is not such difference between titanium coated blades and normal self sharpening blades. My point is, the price difference between BT-1212 did not justified the value addition by battery backup and titanium blades since these not really make a difference in our trimming experience.\n",
          "  I had use this product only one time , after that it is not working ..... really I don't expect this from a company like Philips.  Really I don't know to clime warranty\n",
          "  Product is good; but is hasn't charger, only data cable is given.  I am using my mobile charger for it's charging\n",
          "  I just use this on the minimum setting everyday. I dont miss shaving with razors at all. It lasts around 3 to 4 beard trims, before i need to attach it to my laptop and charge it again. I havent yet attached it to a powerbank to see if it will charge that way. Will that work?\n"

          "  I was using a philips trimmer and bought this after reading reviews. Im very impressed with product. I happened to use and i had an awesome trim.. It fits perfectly in ur hand and the charge drain is very little..\n",
          "  Let me tell you something straight, the length settings, build quality and performance given by this trimmer is unmatched in this price range. Moreover, the trimmer is sleek and charger is micro usb, thus I don't have to carry a separate charger. Go for it blindly. You won't be disappointed.\n",
          "  Awesome product from MI for this Price range.ADVANTAGES:1. Good design2. Battery level Indicator3. 20 length settings4. Handy design5. Micro USB port and cable is also included6. Self sharping bladesDISADVANTAGE:1. This model doesn't have a travel lock2. Low battery backup, we should charge for 2hrs and can use for the only 1hr3. There are no spare or replaceable blades for this product4. In case of any damage to blades, we have to buy another trimmer instead of a replacement.5. This model doesn't have Waterproof material. We can't able to wash the trimmer. But, can be cleaned using brushHope this review will be helpful for the beginners üòá....This product is best for me in this price range. I have bought this for only 899rs.I suggest this product for the beginner and people under budget üëçüèª\n"

          "  Very poor item, firstly , it you start , it start vibrating with huge noise , also you feel your hand start vibrating, felt like I am holding any big drilling machine, and the biggest drawback, other size modes are not working, only size 0 is working rest 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 not working , waste of money, I am really surprised, why Amazon like trsut worthy online site allow such quality of item.\n",
          "  This is my second trimmer from Philips. I'm quite disappointed in this one. For a trimmer of that price it cuts very badly, doesn't give smooth cut. Secondly, the space between the blades and the comb clogs up easily causing the trimmer to jam frequently.The defective part... The on/off switch ceased to function properly within the first month of purchase. And exactly after two months the charger/adaptor stopped working. I'd say a trimmer of lower cost has performed way better\n",
          "  I bought this 3 months back and The product is good but i felt the price is bit high. i bought for Rs.1520. I expect it should range between 1000-1250.Pros====Duration is Good.Nice look.Smooth cutting.Cons======Can't use while chargingCharging time is 8-10 hours.\n",
          "  Update after 6 months use: skin got cut in sensitive areas like arm pit and edge of lips,if you use point 0 or not using the front comb. Bleeded multple times..Worst experience. I have the green trimmer from philips also, it is quite better in terms of safety to skin..People just give 1 star. Not the reason.  Here is the Real reason for 1 star.Dont buy if you want to trim long head hair above 20mm. Or 30mm or above that.It wont work to bring  to 5mm 10 mm.The front comb sucks. Doesn't guides. All the head hair stick to the head scalp only when you pass the trimmer. .May be good for facial hair. (Unfortunately I dont have). I bought to trim head hair growth due to lockdown.If you are trimming, All the trimmed hair,  will stuck in between the front comb and blades.The comb doesn't guide hair to the blades.All the hair which got cut stucks in between blade and comb. Every time after one movement, you need to remove the detachable comb and clean by blowing or with cleaning brush.Never buy trimmer with grill type comb. Always buy trimmer with bottom comb only - similar to saloon one..Else use a separate comb and trim.\n"
