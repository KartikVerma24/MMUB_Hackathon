# MMUB_Hackathon

WebScraping and Automation.
Puppeteer was used as Automation tool.
Javascript will automate going to "Amazon" and "Flipkart" and search for a particular item.
Then First four result of that particular item search (excluding sponsered) will be visited in different tabs and data such as Name of Product, Price, Highlights will be scraped.
Then for each item, Product review page will be visited and top 4 review for each product will also be scraped.
Same will happen for other website too.
all this scraped data will be stored in ProductInfo.json file.

I don't know much about HTML and CSS yet, but later I will try to display the data on webpage.
